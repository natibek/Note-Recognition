# Description

This is a project I developed in my senior year of high school. It is a musical note identification software developed using Javascript utilizing the library p5.js which has many methods for audio analysis. I was very interested in learning songs on guitar but I struggled finding tutorials online for Ethiopian songs since they were not popular. This inspired me to take the steps to produce software that can take audio files as input and tell you what notes where played and how long they were played for.

I did not know much HTML and CSS at that time and focused entirely on making this functional. In the future, I hope to improve this using my new skills in HTML and CSS.
